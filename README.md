# BallerinaHackathon-ApacheCon2019

Come hack some Ballerina code! Ballerina is a statically typed, concurrent programming language, focusing on network interaction and structured data. It is intended to be the core of a language-centric middleware platform. At the Ballerina Hackathon room, you can meet the language creators and learn

- The basics of the language
- How you can design and implement microservices using Ballerina
- How to easily deploy Ballerina artifacts to Kubernetes and Docker

Join us at Lake Mead I and II on Wednesday, September 11 on the lower level. Hack some code and win 4 front row tickets to the #1 greatest show in Las Vegas history - Absinthe. Learn more at https://ballerina.io.
